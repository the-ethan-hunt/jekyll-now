title: What I learnt in KGP
---

A few weeks back, I was at IIT Kharagpur for the Open Source Summit organised by the [Kharagpur Open Source Society](https://kossiitkgp.in/).


I spend a day with people, **great** people who have achieved a lot. These guys no doubt, good in programming and open source but  also 
possessed equal amounts of behaviors and attitudes which were worth to be implemented in our lives. Today's blogpost will be a 
philosophical one, to describe what **I** learnt from KGP- KGP ka gyaan!

1. **No matter what you are, stay humble** - I have met people who have enormous pride and ego despite not achieving something. At 
Kharagpur, there were people who had interned or will be interning at Google, Facebook, Schlumberger, Intuit or any other big-shot 
company. But none of these guys were bragging about it. Some just mentioned it casually in conversation but none talked about it all the 
time. In fact, some did not mention about this at all. Their friends informed me about their achievements. Whatever you do, don't brag 
about it. Let your feet remain on Earth

2. **Never stop. Keep learning, keep doing something** - I asked my close friend a simple question: you have cracked one of the world's 
toughest exam to get here, you have cracked the prestigious Google Summer of Code; why are you running again?

    He replied in a simple way: "That cracking was achievement that time. GSoC was an achievement last year. What about this year? What 
    about now? Don't let yourself be stagnated by stuff you acheived in the past. Set yourself a high bar! Keep working! don't just         sit!". I 
    have to admit that this is one of the most inspiring things I have heard in my life.

3. **Considerate and politeness** - When I met people at the summmit, some of them asked about my journey, whether it was comfortable or 
not. When giving my talk they showed a real interest in what I wanted to say. Even after departing a friend messaged me telling that he and others had a fun time with me. A lot of guys volunteered to help me out whenever I had a doubt or an issue and were more than willing to sort it out. This is the biggest point I want to implement; no matter where have I succeeded, politeness, being considerate and not haughty is a big must.

4. **Curiosity** - Although my talk was on my KWoC project, a lot of people were curious about it. I was asked questions after the 
session, during the break and even in the evening. They showed a natural level of curiosity, trying to absorb as much as I could possibly 
explain. Even during dinner, we were talking about books, there were people who had read more than me but still wanted to know my view 
and my choices of books. The atmosphere really felt like we were a kind of enlightened people at a Congress :). 

5. **An attitude of encouraging** - During the lightning talks that succeeded the talks, a newbie was hesitant in expressing himself. My 
friend in a very friendly way persuaded him to speak up. People at KGP encouraged others to speak up, ask doubts , indulge themselves in 
open source. I found this really pleasing.

I could have written more but I am not able to express them in the form of words. The above points would maybe, wrap it up!
