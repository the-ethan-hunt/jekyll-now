As KWoC finally comes to a glorious end with mentees preparing their documentation posts and mentors filing up the assignments,
I as a mentor for [B.E.N.J.I.](https://github.com/the-ethan-hunt/B.E.N.J.I.), present the top statistics and progress we made
in this eventful month.

## Stats

| Name       |  Number |
| --------   |:-------:|
| Commits    | 267     |
| Issues     | 36      |
| Merged PRs | 42      |
| Total PRs  | 67      |
| Stars      | 18      |
| Forks      | 40      |

## Progress

1. New UI and logo of B.E.N.J.I. created

2. B.E.N.J.I. made compatible for Linux and MacOs versions

3. GUI shifted from `wxpython` to `Tkinter`

4. Improved speech recogition

5. Debugged Youtube and news features

6. Added several more features

## The Other side

Throughout the program, I described my experiences in this blog as well as in Medium. Here are the posts:
 
 - [Day 1-Begin!](https://medium.com/@dhruvgirishapte/day-1-begin-3221f31106d1) 
 - [Week 1-Fighting the battle](https://medium.com/@dhruvgirishapte/week-1-fighting-the-battle-f4669f99b5e7)
 
 Of course, there is also an other side of the story! To hear from the mentee side:
 
 - [Snehal Reddy's post](https://medium.com/@snehalreddykoukuntla/kwoc-2017-8b4d84621659)
 - [Abhimanyu Thakre's post](https://medium.com/@abhimanyuthakre/kwoc-coding-begins-4590bc14508f)
 - [Rohan Kothapalli's post](https://medium.com/@rohanricky/winter-with-kwoc-38d3ab4b1f68)
 
 Indeed, it was a really nice journey mentoring at KWoC: one full of excitement and happiness, mentoring students and programming
