Hello! My name is Dhruv Apte and I am MechE undergraduate who teaches CompSci and trying to work in AeroAstro in graduate school.

I am working to implement hybrid RANS/LES measures in computational fluid dynamics which have lesser computing time and a higher order
of accuracy. I also conduct machine learning lectures, workshops and tutorials for undergraduates to get a notion of one of the most hyped
words of this century.

I am a huge fan of [Dr. Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) (spelled as FINE-man) and his quotes and principles guide me, my beliefs and my enthusiasm to study.
Otherwise, I spend my time reading non-fiction books and watching TV shows; *The Mentalist*,*The Big Bang Theory* and *Riverdale* being my top favourites. I don't watch *Game of Thrones* or *Friends*, either; please don't convince me to watch them. 

I blog not often, the reason being  procastination but I am active on email. I generally reply within 48 hours.
