title: Week 3 at KWoC
---

KWoC(Kharagpur Winter of Code) has entered its third week and we are working to make B.E.N.J.I. better 
and better. We have had some significant improvements:

- [Kaushal Bhogale](https://github.com/kb-studios) made an awesome change in the UI now converting
it into a Mission-Impossible styled one. He also debugged the Windows version. Last week, during 
evaluation, I said I expected more from him. He's proving his mark
- [Abhimanyu Thakre](http://github.com/abhimanyuthakre) has added some more features in the Windows
version by reducing lines of code, adding Google functionality and adding the ShutDown feature.
- [Prasenjit Shaw](https://github.com/jitShaw7) started with a basic yet *important* issue of describing
the activities the digital assistant can do.
- [Rohan Ricky](https://github.com/rohanricky) also debugged the Linux version and added the calculator
He also is becoming the bug-bounty-hunter of the program, detecting some even I could not have thought of
- [Arib Alam](https://github.com/aribalam) is doing the same: bug detection and debugging. He is working
as expected from him.

We also opened the scope of [NLP](https://wikipedia.org/Natural_language_processing) to B.E.N.J.I.. This 
is a discusson topic with making the code modular and introducing AI.

More in my next post!
